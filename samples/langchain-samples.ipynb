It would be acceptable to claim that reducing any of \\nthe above factors may, not will , help to reduce spots.  \\n Furthermore, if a cosmetic has a main primary benefit that is \\nnot to treat acne (e.g. cover-up), a secondary claim to \\nprevent  further spots  would be acceptable (as long as it \\nhas the necessary effect).   \\n(iv) Age spots\\n \\n \\n Age spots, also known as liver spots, are only of cosmetic \\nconcern.   \\n \\n Products to remove them, however, should normally be \\nrecommended by a GP or dermatologist; most products that have the required efficacy to remove age spots are not considered cosmetics. If you consider that your product can \\nreduce age spots you will need to present evidence to QVC to \\ndemonstrate that effect.   Claims should be limited to covering up age spots or helping \\nto prevent them with an SPF (although the role an SPF can \\nplay should not be overstated).
